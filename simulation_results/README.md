# Simulation Results
Simulation results will be output in this directory when the simulation is complete.

To use the WebDEVS viewer, the results will need to be loaded into it alongside a configuration file (sample located at `../misc/hoya_age.json` relative to this directory)

To use the Jupyter Notebook file (located at `../misc/epidemic_plots_from_cd_log_hoya_death_cd_cadmium.ipynb`), you need to copy the `./messages.txt` from here into the same directory as the script.
