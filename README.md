# JSON-configurable Cell-DEVS Hoya model with age-separated population, separation between virulence and susceptibility, deaths, infected capacity, and quarantines
Virulence applies to the people spreading the disease
Susceptibility applies to the people contracting the disease

Mortality rate affects how likely people are to die before recovering
When more people are infected in a cell than the infected capacity, the mortality changes
 - this represents running out of space in hospitals

Each phase of the quarantine is reacted to differently by different age groups.
Each age group has a different rate of disobedience toward the quarantine.
The quarantine is applied as a "mobility correction" on infection contribution from neighboring cells.
