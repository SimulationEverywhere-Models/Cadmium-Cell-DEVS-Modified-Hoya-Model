# JSON-configurable Cell-DEVS Hoya model with age-separated population and lockdowns
Includes lockdowns, which are reacted to by every age group differently (*lockdown_rates*)
Lockdowns reduce connectivity when more people are infected, scaled by a configured factor (*lockdown_adoption*)
(Note: Lockdowns are completely separate from Quarantines)
