# JSON-configurable Cell-DEVS Hoya model with age-separated population, separation between virulence and susceptibility, deaths, and infected capacity
Virulence applies to the people spreading the disease
Susceptibility applies to the people contracting the disease

Mortality rate affects how likely you are to die before recovering
When more people are infected in a cell than the infected capacity, the mortality changes
 - this represents running out of space in hospitals
